# Recognitions manager

This repository contains code mostly generated by AI (DeepSeek). It's a web application to automate the generation, storage, analysis, and sending of recognitions for global initiatives and programs in the Scouts Association of Venezuela.

## Features

*   **Manual and CSV Data Upload:** Users can either input data manually or upload a CSV file to generate recognitions in bulk.
*   **PDF Generation:** The application generates a PDF for each recognition using a predefined template.
*   **Database Storage:** All generated recognitions are stored in a SQLite database for future reference.
*   **Dynamic Filtering:** The main page allows users to filter recognitions by region and search by ID number.
*   **Report Generation:** Users can export data in CSV format, filtered by region and month.
*   **Scout Data Scraping:** The application can scrape data from the official Scouts of Venezuela registry to pre-fill information.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.
